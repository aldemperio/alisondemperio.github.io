Meet Oak-hee.  I got her from Tractor Supply store adoption fair in Hamilton, NY in 2011.  She's a good companion unless you're trying to dress her up for Halloween.  That was the first and last time she ever wore that acorn.

I grew up watching the women in my family sew.  Though I never did quite have the disclipine to sit down and learn pattern sewing, I did pick up the skills to sew abstract things, like matching squirrel + acorn costumes.

My mother made all of the costumes for my dance rectials, even back in the early days where the main success of any performance was having all of the 3-year-olds simply stay stage until the end of the song.  In those days I always ran off stage.  

Then one day I got a taste for the spotlight, and it's never been the same since.  I danced, sang, and acted throughout my youth.  I became a karaoke regular in college; and then went on to be a karaoke jockey in grad school.  Needless to say, I'm very comfortable addressing a crowd, be that at the ol' pub, or in front of executives.
