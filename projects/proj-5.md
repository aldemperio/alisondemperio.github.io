Meet Oak-hee.  I got her from a Tractor Supply store 'adoption fair' in Hamilton, NY in 2011.  She's a good companion unless you're trying to dress her up for Halloween.

I grew up watching the women in my family sew.  Though I never did quite have the disclipine to sit down and learn pattern sewing, I did pick up the skills to sew abstract things, like matching squirrel + acorn costumes.

My mother made all of my dance recital costumes when I was growing up, even back in the early days where the main success of any performance was having all of the 3-year-olds simply stay stage until the end of the song.  In those days I always ran off stage.  

Then one day I got a taste for the spotlight.  I happily danced, sang, and acted throughout my youth.  Though my extra curriculars in college were focused on athletics, I did find a performance outlet singing karaoke at the local Boston bars.  From there I went on to become a karaoke jockey in grad school.  Needless to say, I am very comfortable addressing a crowd, be that at the ol' pub, or in a room full of executives.
