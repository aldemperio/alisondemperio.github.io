I drew this map of a 13,000 mile roadtrip I took the summer of 2009.  I visited 21 National Parks; I =HYPERLINK("http://alisondemperio.blogspot.com/","blogged") about it.  I saw the opportunity for adventure, and I siezed it.

I am opporunistic.  I am eyes and ears to the ground at all times.  I can give you an entire project run down, and I'll tailor it to your concerns and position.  I see opportunities in my project teams, in my department, in my office, and in the company at large.  I raise team members up , while holding all accountable.  I introduce new projects and new ideas.  I improve the Project Management Office.  I challenge assumptions and represent my team and their needs as accuractely as possible.
