title: 'Global Strategy'
---

I recieved my MBA from Thunderbird School of Global Management in December 2010.  During my course of study I was fortunate enough to work with classmates representing over two-dozen different nationalities.  I traveled to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, & Hong Kong for an intensive course on doing business in China; and back on campus I studied Mandarin language.  I traveled to the Silicon Valley to meet with tech giants including Google and Facebook for a tech-focused MBA career series.  I honed my love for diversity, travel, and technology while pursuing this degree.

Currently I manage global project teams with members from the US, England, and Ireland.  Together we work with tier one vendors in the US, Canada, and Korea.  I enable effective, cross-cultural communications by emphasizing overlapping work hours, explaining cultural nuances where appropriate, and promoting the use of agile communication tools.
