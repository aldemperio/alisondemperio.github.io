title: 'Global Strategy'
---

I recieved my MBA from Thunderbird School of Global Management in December 2010.  During my course of study I was fortunate enough to work with classmates representing over two-dozen different nationalities.  I traveled to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, & Hong Kong for an intensive course on doing business in China.  I traveled to the Silicon Valley to meet with tech giants including Google and Facebook for a tech-focused MBA career series.  I honed my love for diversity, travel, and technology while pursuing this degree.

Currently I manage a global project team with members from the US and England; with associated vendors in India and Korea.  I enable effective, cross-cultural communications by emphasizing overlapping work hours, explaining cultural nuances where appropriate, and translating across the pond when necessary.  As research gets underway I am always happy to provide contextual experience to the team, and point to various research studies I leveraged in previous work.
