title: 'Software Project Manager'
---
As a certified Project Management Professional (PMP), I confidently lead projects from initiation to close.  I have experience managing agile and waterfall projects, and the varieties in between.  I work directly with software architects, front-end developers, technical product owners, UX designers, and UX researchers to ensure project deliverables are well understood and exeucuted on.  I ensure stakeholders' requirements are represented in the project plan; I provide frequent status updates; and I anticipate change requests.

I introduce processes and tools to the Project Management Office, yet am careful to implement only those processes and tools that support any given project.
