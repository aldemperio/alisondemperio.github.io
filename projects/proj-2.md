title: 'Automotives & Sustainability'
---

The intersection of automotives and sustainability excites me.  I am particularly passionate about autonomous driving and shared mobility and their respective impact on smart cities and healthier living.  While car ownership is on the brink of decline, the market for substitute services has no limits; and I want to be part of this change from within.

Currently I work in the Oregon Science & Technology Center (OSTC) for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR.)  This fast paced R&D Center is on the cutting edge of infortainment software.  Every day brings about unqiue challenges, as JLR responds to advancing technologies, competition, and corporate OEM constraints.  As a Project Manager, I keep up-to-date on all that is happening within my office and beyond, and anticipate and plan for what lies ahead.

In the summer of 2010 I did an MBA internship with Chrysler (following the merger with Fiat).  I worked on global strategy for a new, small SUV (what became the Jeep Renegade.)  I developed market entry strategy for China, leveraging numerous secondary publications; and contributed to the product market strategy for Italy, helping to structure, recruit, and moderate a research study in Milan.
