The intersection of automotives and sustainability excites me.  I am particularly passionate about autonomous driving and shared mobility and their respective impact on smart cities and healthier living.  While car ownership is on the brink of decline, the market for substitute services has no limits; and I want to be part of this change from within.

Currently I work in the Oregon Science & Technology Center (OSTC) for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR.)  This fast paced R&D Center is on the cutting edge of infortainment software.  Every day brings about unqiue challenges, as JLR responds to advancing technologies, competition, and corporate OEM constraints.  As a Project Manager, I keep up-to-date on all that is happening within my office and beyond, and anticipate and plan for what lies ahead.

In the summer of 2010 I did an MBA internship with Chrysler.  It was a special time for the company as the merger with Fiat had just concluded, the recession was slowing, and they re-introduced the internship program.  I worked on global strategy for new, small SUV (what became the 2015 Jeep Renegade.)  I developed market entry strategy for China, leveraging numerous secondary publications; and I contributed to the foundational research for product strategy for Italy, helping to structure, recruit and moderate the study in Milan.
